# Project007-ToDoApp-JS-v2
This is a basic To-Do-Task App developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
User can add tasks, check or uncheck them changing their status or can delete it.
The tasks will be stored in browser local storage. The clean button on the top-right corner will delete all tasks.
There is language select checkbox developed using CSS and the target text is located with JS as well.

Still needs improvements on;
GUI,
Scrolling etc.
